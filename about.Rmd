### PhD Candidate at Columbia University (current role)

Rae Spriggs (she/her) is a third-year Environmental Health Sciences doctoral candidate at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. Her research sits at intersection of extreme climate exposures, social vulnerability (racial and ethnic composition, historical environmental injustice, and pollution burden), and mental health outcomes. She works under the mentorship of Dr. Robbie M. Parks and Dr. Annie Nigra. 

Her previous project with Dr. Nigra explores and characterizes multiple environmental exposures (drinking water quality, extreme heat, air pollution, etc.) impacting U.S. correctional facilities. Manuscript in progress!

Her dissertation research with Dr. Parks is evaluating spatiotemporal trends in mental health-related mortality in response to extreme climate exposures such as tropical cyclones and wildfires.
