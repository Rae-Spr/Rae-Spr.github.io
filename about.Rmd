### PhD Candidate at Columbia University (current role)

Rae Spriggs (she/her) is a fourth-year Environmental Health Sciences doctoral candidate at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. Her research sits at the intersection of extreme climate exposures, social vulnerability (racial and ethnic composition, historical environmental injustice, and economic disadvantage), and mental health outcomes. She works under the mentorship of Dr. Robbie M. Parks and Dr. Annie Nigra. 

Her previous project with Dr. Nigra explores and characterizes multiple environmental exposures (drinking water quality, extreme heat, air pollution, etc.) impacting U.S. correctional facilities. Manuscript in progress!

Her dissertation research with Dr. Parks is evaluating spatiotemporal trends and disparities in mental health-related mortality, as well as the association with extreme climate exposures such as tropical cyclones. Manuscript(s) in progress -- stay tuned!

Expected completion of the PhD in Spring 2027.
