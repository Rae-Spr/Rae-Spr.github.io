### PhD Student at Columbia University (current role)

Rae Spriggs (she/her) is a second year Environmental Health Sciences doctoral student at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. She has two ongoing research projects and is under the mentorship of Dr. Robbie M. Parks and Dr. Annie Nigra. One project is exploring and characterizing multiple environmental exposures (drinking water quality, extreme heat, air pollution, etc.) impacting U.S. correctional facilities. The other project is evaluating spatio-temporal trends in mental health related mortality in response to extreme climate exposures such as tropical cyclones and wildfires. 

In her dissertation research, Rae plans to explore the intersection of extreme climate exposures, neighborhood conditions (racial/ethnic composition, historical environmental injustice, etc.), and mental health outcomes.
